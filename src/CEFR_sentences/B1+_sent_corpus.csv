"And there are ways to control malaria that don't use chemicals at all."
"Vector control is not the only way to stop malaria."
"And DDT is not the only chemical that can be used for vector control."
"The best way to stop malaria is to use a combination of methods."

"The Valley of the Kings, the Europeans called it."

"They'd found nothing for months."
"He liked Mr Carter."
"Carter was indeed feeling depressed."
"No more tombs to be discovered."
"No more treasure to be found."
"No more to be learnt."
"But Carter was convinced that the experts were wrong."
"He was determined to sweep the valley from one end to the other."
"The young king, who had died mysteriously all those thousands of years ago."
"Forget what the experts said."
"Carter had a nose for this kind of work and..."
"Carter watched his men digging at the rocky soil."
"They didn't know what he knew."
"That this was his last chance."
"That if nothing was found soon, then digging would cease."
"Chipping, shovelling, scraping, clearing."
"As Carter watched and worried, the waterboy idly scratched at the soil."
"The rubble felt sharp and hot beneath his hands."
"His palms were thick with dust."
"He crouched, sweeping aside the dirt."
"And then more dirt."
"And then something hard."
"The waterboy swept faster, ignoring the sharpness of the stones."
"It was something wide, and flat, and made of stone."
"He looked up, shielding his eyes from the fierce glare of the sun."
"Carter jumped to his feet and hurried over."
"Voices started up all around."
"Probably found a fragment of a pot,"" they mumbled to themselves."
"The waterboy dug at the earth with his hands."
"He could feel his heart pounding."
"Howard Carter joined him."
"It was a step."
"There was a flat surface, so smooth it must have been manmade."
"Along one edge, the stone turned downwards, into the ground."
"Carter ordered the workmen to dig here."
"The waterboy stood back."
"Dozens of spades were aimed at the area in front of the step."
"Dazzling sunlight threw twisting shadows on the ground as they worked."
"However tired they were feeling, they dug as quickly as they could."
"This could be a find."
"This could mean bonus payments for all of them!"
"Soon a second step had been cleared."
"Carter could hardly contain his excitement."
"No, don't get your hopes up yet,"" he told himself."
"It might be nothing."
"It might be nothing of importance."
"Or it might be the one tomb he'd spent years looking for."
"One step after another."
"Down, and down."
"Until there were sixteen."
"Across its rough surface were... markings...?"
"Carter took a closer look."
"They were the imprints of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics."
"But they were clearly there."
"This was an ancient hiding place of some sort, that much was certain."
"The waterboy flicked his hair from his eyes with a grimy hand."
"Their thoughts were on their bonuses."
"This was going to be a good day for them, too."
"Carter took off his hat and fanned his face for a moment or two."
"Flies buzzed around his head and he swatted them away."
"Now was a time for clear, careful thought."
"Carter dashed back up the steps."
"This had better be worth it, Carter, m'boy,"" he grumbled."
"Come along, girl!"
"Lady Evelyn mumbled something that nobody else heard."
"I simply can't stay out in these conditions a moment more than necessary!"
"Carter was hurrying over to the excavation."
"The waterboy grumbled under his breath."
"Carnarvon followed Carter down the staircase."
"Carter was already impatient to proceed."
"He beckoned to the old man hurriedly."
"Carnarvon made his way down the rock-strewn steps as fast as he could."
"You see the shape of the cartouches, the ovals which contain the hieroglyphs?"
"At first, I thought that it could be the tomb of a noble."
"Or perhaps a store for the royal family."
"But then..."" ""Then what?"
"He paused for a moment, suddenly realising what Carter meant."
"So you've found a name?"
"Lady Evelyn appeared at the top of the steps."
"For the first time, she saw the wall-seal marked with ancient writing."
"Did we bring a hamper with us?"
"Carter paid no attention to what she was saying."
"He looked at Carnarvon steadily."
"We have a name,"" he said."
"He dusted down the lower part of the plaster."
"The impressions are better preserved down here."
"Nine slaves, beneath the picture of a jackal."
"And here, three sets of symbols spelling out the name of the pharaoh."
"Lord Carnarvon squatted down and peered at the hieroglyphs with screwed-up eyes."
"Can't get close enough, m'boy."
"Not with m'back playing up."
"You'll have to translate for me."
"Carter pointed to the three sets of symbols, one after the other."
"Tut... Ankh... Amun..."" Carnarvon sat back on the steps."
"He put out a hand to steady himself."
"Good Lord,"" he whispered."
"This is the tomb you've been searching for all these years."
"Carter pointed to the top left corner of the plaster."
"It's not all good news."
"Up there, can you see?"
"There was a triangular section in the corner which looked different from the rest."
"In ancient times, I believe."
"There may be something left inside, though."
"The robbers wouldn't have bothered to re-seal a completely empty tomb."
"Then let's not delay,"" said Carnarvon."
"Stop getting in the way up there, girl!"
"Let the diggers through!"
"The plaster seal was demolished."
"Someone had been there before them."
"He turned to his men."
"Let's get it clear!"
"For hours they toiled."
"The sun slowly moved across the sky."
"The burnt orange glow of late afternoon bathed the steps leading to the tomb."
"Up the steps came workers laden with full buckets."
"Down the steps went workers with empty buckets."
"A steady, unending parade, up and down, down and up."
"Exactly like the first, a thick plaster block across the corridor."
"Carter rushed to examine it."
"Carter's fingers delicately traced the outlines of the hieroglyphs."
"The light from the candle shuddered."
"He realised his hand was shaking."
"What d'you think's behind this wall?"
"His voice echoed in the stone corridor."
"All in all, it's still an important archaeological find."
"For minutes there was only the sound of metal scratching at the seal."
"Nobody said a word."
"Lady Evelyn hardly dared to breathe."
"Partly, it was fear of the unknown."
"Whether this tomb had been robbed or not, it was still a tomb."
"His voice sounded loud and dense in the stuffy atmosphere of the corridor."
"Carter held the candle to the hole, to test for poisonous gases."
"I think it's safe,"" he whispered at last."
"Look inside, m'boy,"" said Carnarvon."
"Can you see if the room is very large?"
"Carter moved up close to the hole he had made in the wall."
"Hot air was still flowing from inside."
"It brushed against his face."
"The hole was a ragged, black shape."
"And beyond it...?"
"Carter took the candle."
"Grit and plaster fragments edged inside his sleeve as his arm slid forward."
"At first, he could see nothing."
"The glow from the candle was faint and shifting."
"But as his eyes grew accustomed to the gloom, shapes began to emerge."
"And all reflecting the candlelight with the glowing shine of gold."
"Carter could hardly speak."
"Wonderful things,"" he whispered at last."
"But it had been a very long day."
"Everyone went home for the night."
"He'd designed it himself, and called it Castle Carter."
"None of them anticipated getting any sleep."
"It had eaten Carter's pet bird."
"Filthy beast,"" grumbled Carnarvon."
"It's just doing what it does to survive,"" mumbled Carter."
"The moment when we broke into the tomb,"" said Lady Evelyn."
"Father, I'm getting frightened."
"They say these ancient tombs are cursed."
"Steady on, girl,"" said Carnarvon, feeling rather unsteady."
"Superstitious nonsense,"" said Carter."
"The local people don't believe in all that curse business."
"It's us Europeans who like to make up silly stories."
"We have to deal in facts."
"And the facts are that this could be the find of the century."
"I agree,"" said Carnarvon."
"We have to handle the situation very carefully."
"Something like this can't be kept quiet,"" nodded Carter."
"There's never been a find like it before."
"It could make headline news across the world."
"Before we know it, the valley will be swarming with people."
"So we must work out exactly what we've got down there."
"As soon as possible."
"Get them to send out their top chaps."
"Carter paused for a moment."
"I was thinking... rather sooner than that."
"I was thinking we should take a closer look tonight."
"You must be mad!"
"We have electric torches,"" said Carter."
"We have our knowledge of the ancient Egyptians to guide us."
"What we don't have is time."
"The heat of the day had vanished completely, replaced by a dry chill."
"He would have kicked himself if he'd known what he was missing."
"Each carried a brightly shining flashlight which threw a wide beam across the walls."
"The sound of their footsteps seemed unbearably loud."
"Carter dug at the wall."
"The room was about eight metres wide, four metres deep."
"Its walls were plain stone."
"It was as if the tomb had been sealed only yesterday."
"I feel like we shouldn't be here,"" whispered Lady Evelyn."
"They aimed their torches this way and that."
"The horns of a sacred ox sculpture shone out of the darkness."
"To the left were the broken remains of chariots."
"Broken by the ancient tomb robbers."
"The annexe was a chaotic mess of smashed odds and ends."
"Then they stole everything in this annexe and left, re-sealing the entrance."
"They must have intended to come back, but something stopped them."
"Perhaps they were killed for the treasures they'd already taken."
"Perhaps the location of this tomb was lost for some reason."
"Either way, it's to our great good fortune."
"Suddenly Lady Evelyn gasped."
"She almost dropped her torch in fright."
"Guardians,"" whispered Carter."
"Between the guardians was a richly decorated casket."
"Carter and Carnarvon lifted it to one side and stood before the third seal."
"In the sharp torchlight, their faces were a maze of light and dark."
"Their breathing echoed off the ceiling."
"Carter began to dig at the base of the seal this time."
"He placed his torch to one side."
"The carved faces of animals watched from the darkness."
"Well,"" said Carter at last."
"Let's see what's inside, shall we?"
"The hole was small."
"Carter shone his flashlight through to the other side."
"Reflected back were ancient Egyptian designs, shaped in gold against a vibrant blue."
"Is it made of gold?"
"No, wood I think,"" said Carter."
"With gold laid over the top."
"It might be a box, or the side of a large ornament."
"Perhaps we should make a second hole to one side?"
"To get around it?"
"He coughed as stirred-up dust clung around his face."
"I don't think we'll need to,"" he said."
"There's just enough space to crawl through and stand up in."
"He struggled to twist himself around."
"Whatever this is here, it's quite big."
"I can't feel a corner yet."
"You two go through,"" said Carnarvon."
"I'm feeling as ancient as these artefacts meself!"
"Don't think I'd quite make the squeeze."
"Carter was already hauling himself through into the blackness beyond."
"He'd left his torch in the outer chamber."
"The gap between the wall-seal and the whatever-it-was was barely half a metre."
"He groped cautiously to the left."
"Then he felt something on the floor..."
"Loose, round... A jar, perhaps."
"He looked over his shoulder."
"Careful, girl,"" called Carnarvon."
"Priceless relics in there, don't forget!"
"Still treats me like a baby,"" mumbled Lady Evelyn to herself."
"She stretched out her arms."
"Neither can I,"" whispered Carter."
"It must be a good five metres wide."
"From the outer chamber, Carnarvon pushed two torches through the hole."
"A pair of eyes!"
"Carter's torch shone on the side of the huge object."
"Lady Evelyn had never felt so frightened in her life."
"She pressed her back to the wall, and held up her torch."
"It lit up the whole room."
"Ancient life and ancient times loomed over them from the walls."
"In another, he met Osiris, god of the dead."
"In another, the dog-headed Anubis, the embalmer."
"The huge object in front of them was that same wooden shrine."
"It took up almost the entire chamber."
"But it was the shrine that commanded their attention."
"I need more light!"
"Lady Evelyn squeezed around the corner of the shrine and crouched down beside Carter."
"The final room,"" breathed Carter."
"That's the god Anubis, watching over the dead king."
"He turned back to the small doors in the shrine."
"Is there anything there?"
"The shrine is unbroken,"" said Carter."
"It hasn't been opened for over three thousand years."
"So... what's inside this shrine?"
"Tutankhamun himself,"" whispered Carter."
"And inside that... the mummy of the king."
"Undisturbed for thousands of years."
"Lying here, in the silence, in the darkness."
"With trembling hands, he pulled back the bolt that held the doors shut."
"Story Background Howard Carter's discovery was one of the greatest finds in history."

"Please ring the bell."
"That's the job for me,' said Doohickey."
"A loud alarm sounded inside the house, followed by a terrific explosion."
"A window flew open at the top of the house."
"A cloud of thick smoke billowed out."
"The professor's face peered down at Doohickey."
"I've come about the job.'"
"A moment later, the front door sprang half-open."
"A huge mountain of post had stopped the door from opening properly."
"But there was no one there."
"A buzzer sounded in Doohickey's ear."
"He was surprised to see a little air-ship bobbing in the hallway beside him."
"Tiny propellers spun the ship around."
"Chapter Two He followed the ship up a tall, winding staircase."
"He passed room after room stuffed full of strange-looking machines."
"Were they the professor's inventions?"
"He popped into one of the rooms to take a closer look."
"The cage seemed to be stuffed full of straw."
"Doohickey pushed his hand into it."
"A tiny needle was sticking out of his thumb."
"There was a label fixed to the computer screen."
"The next machine had lots of electric fans fixed beneath a large metal funnel."
"There was sand all over the floor."
"He switched it on."
"Sand began trickling out of the funnel and the fans started spinning."
"Then the strangest thing happened."
"The sand didn't fall on to the floor."
"It hung in the air."
"And slowly, it shaped itself into a floating castle."
"Doohickey walked slowly around the machine."
"He couldn't believe what he was seeing."
"Then all of a sudden, he bumped into someone else."
"When he saw who it was, he nearly jumped out of his skin."
"The other person was him!"
"It was like looking in a mirror, except that there was no glass."
"Doohickey reached out his hand and the other Doohickey did the same."
"It was too creepy!"
"He stepped backwards straight into the floating sand-castle."
"The castle exploded and Doohickey found himself in the middle of a sandstorm."
"Sand blew everywhere, into his eyes and up his nose."
"And so had the other Doohickey!"
"Then Doohickey noticed a large metal plate on the floor."
"There was another label on it."
"The metal plate was another of the professor's inventions."
"It had made the other Doohickey appear when he had stepped on to it."
"I won't try that again, he thought."
"It's a bit too spooky."
"Doohickey saw the air-ship bobbing up and down in the doorway."
"It had come back to find him."
"He couldn't think of a better excuse."
"The ship buzzed again crossly and glided back towards the stairs."
"Chapter Three They reached the top of the house."
"The air-ship led Doohickey into a smoky attic."
"It was stuffed full of books, test tubes and lumps of tangled wiring."
"A small shaggy dog peered out at him from beneath a workbench."
"A cat lay sunning itself on the window sill."
"He was hunched over a heap of metal in one corner."
"It didn't look very exciting."
"He expected that it was a machine for getting blood from a stone."
"Or for making omelettes without breaking eggs."
"The professor scribbled some words on to a scrap of paper."
"He fed the paper through the slot in the robot's chest."
"Then he pressed a big button and stepped back."
"The robot hummed and whirred for a bit."
"Then it climbed slowly to its feet."
"Its head almost scraped the attic ceiling."
"The lights on the robot's face flickered on and off."
"It looked as if it was thinking about something."
"And then ... it painted a picture of the professor's dog."
"It played a piece of music on the test tubes."
"And it discovered three new ways of splitting the atom."
"He was really amazed."
"Besides, I've got better things for you to do.'"
"He handed Doohickey the list of jobs."
"If you can't find anything, ask Newton.'"
"Doohickey didn't know what to say to this."
"So he looked at the list of jobs the professor had given him."
"These jobs are all boring,' said Doohickey."
"He tore up the list and threw it into a bin."
"Look at all these silly machines, he thought."
"Then he had a brain-wave."
"He set off upstairs again."

"Chapter 5 - Next stop, Patagonia!"

"So why didn't they work for Dani's agents?"

"The watches use our energy to shrink."
"I wouldn't be so sure,"" said Cat."
"She always did worry about us."
"How would you three like a trip to Patagonia?"
"Sounds good to me,"" Tiger grinned."
"But how will we get there?"

"I'm getting a strange reading."
"Ant peered at the computer screen."
"It looks like another craft was here not long ago."
"And it used a massive amount of power before flying away again."
"Do you know where it went?"
"No, but we can easily follow it."
"It left a huge energy trail."
"Ant gave Tiger the coordinates for a new course."
"The air in Hawkwing began to chill."
"Before long, Max spotted another craft in the distance."
"Then he looked down at his watch."
"The X-bot alert had started to flash a warning."
"But I thought we got rid of them."
"And that thing doesn't look like any X-bot we've seen before."
"Is it some sort of super X-bot?"
"Max stared through Hawkwing's view port at the machine in front of them."
"Cat, can you magnify that thing it's holding?"
"Cat activated her watch."
"Zooming in on it now."
"Hey, it's the whales!"
"Ant yelled, as the picture appeared on Cat's watch."
"And they're inside some sort of globe."
"They've been shrunk to micro-size."
"How and why have they been put into that silly globe?"
"I'd like to know that myself,"" Max replied."
"But first things first."
"We have to save the whales."
"Hang on to your seats!"
"Chapter 7 - Save the whales!"
"Max fired up the afterburners and Hawkwing shot forward, chasing the strange X-bot."
"They got closer and closer, until at last they were just behind it."
"Luckily, the X-bot did not appear to have detected them."
"Shall we try and grab the globe using Hawkwing's claws?"
"No, it's too dangerous,"" Max replied."
"We might break the glass and hurt the whales."
"We need to use our watches to make the globe grow."
"Can we open the front hatch?"
"Tiger pulled a lever."
"Max put Hawkwing into autopilot and activated the tracking device."
"He programmed Hawkwing to follow the X-bot."
"Then he turned to the others."
"Right everyone,"" he shouted, ""point your watches at the globe."
"Now turn the dials clockwise twice and press the X."
"Cat, Ant and Tiger did as Max said."
"A purple beam blasted out of each watch towards the globe."
"Immediately, it began to grow."
"The whales are growing too!"
"The globe grew bigger and bigger and so did the whales inside it."
"They're falling towards the sea,"" shouted Cat."
"What shall we do?"
"Try and lower them gently,"" said Tiger."
"The children's arms strained forwards."
"They felt themselves being pulled towards the open hatch."
"Hawkwing soared along beside it."
"The globe grew to the size of a car."
"Dropping the globe, the X-bot plummeted towards the water."
"The children were tugged forwards as they took the full weight of the globe."
"They struggled to control their beam as the sea loomed closer below them."
"We're directly above the sea at Station W,"" said Cat."
"Finally, the globe plunged into the sea."
"Are the whales OK?"
"Yes, they're fine,"" Ant replied."
"The globe protected them in the fall."
"How are we going to get them out of that globe?"
"I don't know,"" said Max."
"But there's one person who will know what to do."
"Tiger knew who Max meant."
"Dani stood waiting for them."
"Her arms were folded, her lips pursed."
"Cat, Tiger and Ant stayed behind him."
"What on earth have you kids been up to?"
"You've rescued the whales?"
"But that's what I sent my new agents to do."
"How did you manage it?"
"You'd better tell me everything."
"They told her about the watches."
"They told her about their journey to Station W and about the strange X-bot."
"Dani immediately radioed the base commander."
"He reassured her that the whales were fine."
"Dani put the phone down."
"Chapter 9 - The Collector Dani paced the floor of the control room."
"You completely disobeyed my orders."
"After a moment Dani sighed."
"But you've done an amazing job."
"And it seems you are the only ones who can use the watches."
"Being micro-sized is crucial in order to avoid detection."
"I don't have any other choice, do I?"
"She managed a smile."
"How would you like to work for me ... as my new Team X?"
"I better tell you everything that has happened."
"We also found some very interesting film from a security camera."
"A short, grainy piece of film appeared."
"Onto his desk dropped several glinting diamonds."
"What does it mean?"
"We do know what the X-bot looks like, though."
"A new picture appeared on the screen."
"That's the craft we saw!"
"That's what I thought,"" said Dani."
"Now we need to find out who this man is."
"I need to know why he and his X-bot want to kidnap endangered animals."
"Just then a woman in a NICE uniform appeared."
"Delivery for you, Dani,"" she said, handing Dani a package."
"Dani opened the parcel and gasped."
"Inside it was a beautiful snow globe."
"It's like the globe the X-bot was carrying!"
"The globe contained a note."
"It was very strange."
"But Max smiled to himself."
"It was very exciting, as well."
"This was just the beginning."
"They discovered the whales."

"Remember what happens when your watch gets wet?"
"Tiger said to Ant."
"You want to grow Robo-Rex?"
"Just at that moment there was a fizzing noise from Ants watch."

"Think you can do any better?"
"Cat held up her hands as Tiger shoved the remote towards her."

"I'm not doing it."

"But it will need time to dry."
"Cat, Ant and Nok joined them at the rear of the ship."
"I'll go with Cat and Nok to look for the fragment."
"No problem,"" said Ant."
"Nok was staring hard into the distance."
"I think we need to go that way,"" he said."
"I can feel the energy from the fragment,"" Nok replied."

"Let's get going then,"" said Max."

"They all grew to normal size."

"Quick, we need to get to the cave!"
"The shimmering dust began to swirl faster."
"They started to cough and splutter."
"It looked as if the walls were covered in tiny stars."
"Wow,"" said Cat, gazing round."
"Where's the fragment?"
"Nok spotted a picture etched into the wall."
"As he touched it, blue power surged from his hand lighting it up."
"It's a map,"" said Cat."
"Look, there's an X,"" Max said."

"How Do We See?"
"Leigh Haeger Thanks to light, you can see."
"Light reflects, or bounces, off objects and travels to your eyes."
"Light enters the eye through the pupil."
"The pupil is the black circle in the middle of the eye."
"After entering the pupil, light passes through the lens."
"The retina has two types of light-sensitive cells."
"Rods detect black and white."
"The retina turns the light image into electrical signals."
"Those signals travel to the brain through the optic nerve."
"The brain then turns the image right side up."

"He found a stone and kicked it along the pavement."
"I hate that house, he thought."
"I hate it I hate it!"
"After a minute, he had the sensation that someone was watching him."
"It was the girl who had been staring over the fence the previous evening."
"She was sitting on a swing in the park, alone."
"They locked eyes, and so Jack crossed the street."
"Hi,"" he said."
"The girl looked at him with curiosity but didn't say anything."
"I saw you last night,"" he persisted, ""over the fence."
"The last family that lived there disappeared."
"Maybe,"" said the girl, pushing off the ground and swinging forwards."
"But nobody's been there since."
"Jack stared at the back of the gloomy building and shivered."
"Jack got back to the house an hour later."
"There was no answer."
"Jack remembered the girl's words."
"He jumped as he heard a door slam."
"He ran up stairs, heart thumping, and banged on her door."

"Isn't this great?"

"This is the new start we all needed,"" his dad said."

"It had begun to rain."
"By the time they got home, the wind had picked up."
"Jack's dad unlocked the door and flicked on the light."
"Nevertheless it was a lot warmer in the house now."
"Jack could smell the same stale smell he had noticed coming from the cellar."
"His dad noticed it too."
"It smells funny in here,"" he said."
"It's coming from the cellar,"" replied Jack, holding his nose."
"It smells like something's died."
"Maybe there's another rat."
"I'll check it out in the morning."
"Just then, his dad's mobile began to ring."
"It was the police."
"Can I come with you?"
"His dad checked his watch."
"It's getting late."
"I don't know how long I'm going to be."

"He pushed the plastic switch and the beam flicked on."
"Outside the rain had become a full storm."
"The house began to groan."
"Downstairs, he heard a door creak open."
"But his mouth was dry and the word stuck in his throat."
"It was as if the sound had just appeared in his head."
"But then he heard it again more clearly, just like the first time."
"He slipped out of his sleeping bag and opened the door to his room."
"Jack shone the torch round."
"The boxes piled in the hall created toothy shadows up the wall."
"There was a light on downstairs."

"You can do that?"
"You're looking at the best scientists on the planet."
"Where will the asteroid end up?"
"Whatever era the portal was set to, of course."
"But Max is there too."

"Better not get it wrong then."
"We need your help to save the planet."
"We've got one attempt at this."
"He'll have figured out a way to stay out of trouble."

"It's safe to come out now."
"You could have helped me."
"Now why would I do that?"
"Because I saved you."

"Then your world must be a very lonely place."
"Why not use the vortex?"
"I thought it only went one way."
"Kalvin didn't seem to have any intention of returning to 2099."
"The best scientists on the planet, remember?"
"Now to reconfigure the vortex to bring you back."
"It won't take long."
"But we need to go now!"
"Who knows what danger Max might be in."
"We have to help him."
"OK. Go through now."
"We'll just have to reconfigure the vortex after you've left."
"You just might be stuck on your own for a couple of minutes."
"What can possibly happen to us in a couple i	of minutes?"
"I think I'm going to throw up."

"He fitted on the big, flappy elephant ears."
"What shall I say first?"
"He gave his ears four twists and two waggles."
"The elephants took no notice."
"They carried on chewing leaves."
"Dad's right,"" thought Eric, sadly."
"This ear language is rubbish!"
"He gave it one more try."
"None of the big elephants waggled ""Hello!"
"Then two baby elephants wandered up to the fence."
"They were called Maya and Miko."
"Maya began waggling her ears."
"Three flaps, two left ear waggles."
"Does that mean anything?"
"He hardly dared to hope."
"He looked it up in his little blue book."
"Yes, it does!"
"An elephant is actually talking to me!"
"What is outside the big gates?"
"Maya was asking him."
"Does she mean outside the zoo?"
"He looked at the little blue book."
"It was a very hard question to answer."
"Ear language had no words for cars or crowds or busy roads."
"There was a quiet little park just outside the zoo gates."
"But there was no word for 'park' in ear language, either."
"Maya was getting impatient."
"Ah, here's something!"
"He'd found a word."
"It wasn't right, but it would have to do."
"Flap, flap went his ears."
"There is a jungle outside the big gates/1 Eric told the baby elephants."
"Maya waved her trunk in surprise."
"The jungle is so close?"
"Yes,"" answered Eric."
"He thought of the little park."
"It wasn't exactly a jungle."
"But it did have a few trees."
"And Maya was never going to find out."
"She was a zoo animal."
"She was never going to go outside."
"I have heard about the jungle,"" Miko's ears told him."
"I, too,"" waggled Maya."
"The old elephants tell us stories."
"The jungle is a wonderful place."
"What are they saying?"
"He couldn't keep up."
"Their ears were flapping so fast they were just a blur."
"Maya and Miko rushed off, still talking ear language."
"They seemed really excited."
"Maybe it's because they talked to a human for the first time!"
"He felt much more confident now."
"He felt like having a chat with the hyenas."
"The hyenas told jokes about visitors."
"They laughed at them all the time."
"Look at that silly man."
"His face is as red as a baboon's bottom!"
"Eric talked with the timid gazelles, next."
"They seemed to worry a lot."
"They might eat us all up!"
"He even dared to have a word with the lions."
"They seemed very keen to invite him inside their cages."
"Come closer, human child!"
"His eyes glittered greedily."
"Come closer, so I may smell you."
"Er, sorry, I haven't got time,"" Eric told him."
"I'm just off to see some potbellied pigs."
"I adore pigs,"" the lion replied, licking his lips."
"It's brilliant fun!"
"He felt as if he'd been talking ear language all his life!"
"Chapter 3 What's Going On?"
"Then, soon after, something strange happened at the zoo."
"The gazelles were skipping about."
"The hyenas were running round in mad circles."
"Why are they all so excited?"
"He headed for the elephant pen."
"He had to ask Maya and Miko about it."
"He fixed on his elephant ears."
"Two flicks and a waggle meant: ""What's going on?"
"But Maya and Miko didn't run up to greet him."
"Maya and Miko were far away at the other side of their pen."
"Their grey ears seemed busy."
"They had lots to say."
"But they were talking to the kangaroos over the fence, not to him."
"Eric felt rather left out."
"He watched their ears."
"He could keep up now, no matter how fast they moved."
"Don't be silly,"" Maya was telling the kangaroos."
"We elephants can't jump."
"We will all find our own way out."
"The kangaroos can jump fences, the hyenas can dig under them."
"The elephants will use their strength to push the fences down!"
"The jungle the human child told us about."
"We will all be free!"
"As Eric watched, he felt his heart grow cold."
"He suddenly realized what they were up to."
"The animals were planning a mass break-out!"
"And it was all because of him."
"He hadn't used the right words."
"He'd told them there was a jungle outside the zoo."
"There were motorways out there."
"The animals would get run over."
"And where would they find food?"
"There were no keepers to feed them outside the gates."
"I can't believe this is happening!"
"He had to find out more."
"He felt like a spy."
"We will escape today!"
"Like Chinese whispers, the message spread all round the zoo."
"And there was nothing he could do to stop it."
"Eric could hear the whoops as the monkeys got it."
"Then the roar as it reached the lions."
"Soon, the whole zoo was buzzing with news of the mass break-out."
"Suddenly, Maya saw Eric."
"Hello, human child!"
"Did you hear what we said?"
"Yes,"" admitted Eric."
"He didn't want to lie to the animals."
"They thought he was their friend."
"Chapter 4 ""You Told us the Truth?"
"We are very grateful to you!"
"You told us the truth."
"The jungle is so close!"
"We cannot wait to get there."
"It is our dream!"
"Eric took hold of the strings that worked his elephant ears."
"He wanted to waggle, ""There is no jungle!"
"You don't understand!"
"It will be terrible out there."
"You could all die!"
"But he just couldn't do it."
"He couldn't spoil the animals' dreams."
"He let his hands drop."
"What is that kangaroo asking us?"
"I can't quite see."
"Miko squinted through the fence with his tiny elephant eyes."
"He is asking, 'Does the human child know about our plans?"
"What if he tells the keepers?"
"They will stop our escape!'"
"His ears flapped furiously."
"We can trust the human child!"
"He is on our side!"
"Eric trudged away from the elephant pen."
"His mind was in torment."
"What on earth was he going to do?"
"Dreadful thoughts were growing like monsters in his brain."
"He'd only thought about the animals, up to now."
"He hadn't thought about the danger to humans."
"What if the lions escaped?"
"I'm going to have to tell!"
"I'm going to have to!"
"He set off to find Dad."
"He was still struggling to make up his mind."
"He passed the gazelles."
"They were skipping about in a frenzy."
"Their ears flickered, ""We are going outside to the jungle."
"Oh, no,"" groaned Eric."
"What if they get hit by cars?"
"What if they meet the crocodiles?"
"It was no good."
"He couldn't wriggle out of it any longer."
"He pushed open the door to the keepers' room."
"He knew Dad would be having his tea break."
"Dad,"" he said, in a small shaky voice."
"I've got something really important to tell you."
"At first, Dad didn't believe him."
"He kept saying, ""This is a joke, isn't it?"
"Two gazelles and a kangaroo have just jumped over the fence!"
"Then Dad began to believe it."
"Call out all the keepers!"
"This is an emergency!"
"The animals' escape was over before it began."
"The keepers saw to that."
"The two gazelles and the kangaroo were put back in their pens."
"As the kangaroo was led back, he saw Eric standing with the keepers."
"His ears started waggling."
"The first gazelle twitched her ears angrily."
"You did it so humans wouldn't get hurt."
"You had to tell!"
"The keepers thought he was a hero."
"But that didn't make him feel any better."
"The animals thought he was a big sneak."
"Eric felt really upset about that."
"Chapter 6 Rabbit Talk At home, Eric stood by the dustbin."
"I'm going to throw this ear language stuff away,"" he decided."
"None of the animals would ever speak to him again."
"And, anyway, it had caused nothing but trouble."
"He threw the elephant ears into the bin."
"Then the gazelle ears."
"Then all the other ears."
"They were long and floppy."
"They were white and silky."
"Wait a minute, I know!"
"He'd meant to throw everything away."
"But, instead, he ran down to the end of the garden."
"Fluffy, his pet rabbit, was out in her run."
"Eric searched through the little blue book."
"He found the page headed Rabbit Talk."
"He just couldn't stop himself."
"He fitted the ears on to the hat."
"He put the hat on his head."
"Three waggles and two flicks meant, ""What is your favourite food?"
"Dandelions,"" Fluffy told him, blinking her pink eyes."
"And what do you like doing best?"
"Sunbathing,"" answered Fluffy."
"At least I've still got one animal to talk to!"

"My name is Ting Yan."
"Andwe have three deputy directors here."
"MR. RHEE: Thank you, Ting."
"And good evening in Asia again."
"So let's start withour key messages."
"Regionaloutput is projected to grow by 5.6 percent in 2018 and 2019."
"That is about4.1 percent percentage point higher than we expected in October."
"This overthe region was supported by external demand as well as accommodativefinancial conditions."
"Third, Asia has enjoyed relatively subdued inflation even the growth hasbeen picking up."
"But policymakers should not be complacent."
"So let me expand on these points before we turnto your questions."
"So let's move on to the risk factors."
"And geopolitical tensions could have seriousrepercussions on financial market and on the real economy."
"Asia risks becoming old before becoming rich."
"Asia alsoexperiences a significant productivity growth slowdown since the globalfinancial crisis."
"Let me move to the policy recommendations."
"Against this backdrop, policyshould aim to strengthen buffers, increase resilience and ensuresustainability."
"Subdued inflation provides scope for accommodative monetary policy stancein much of Asia."
"So let me reiterate our key message before concluding."
"And the region faces seriousstructural challenges over the longer term."
"And policy making shouldbe prudent and focus on increasing resilience."
"Now let's turn toyour questions."
"MS. YAN: Thank you."
"Please identify yourself before you ask questions andwe will take a few questions together."
"IMF raised the WorldEconomic Outlook projection to 3.9 percent this year and next year."
"That is0.2 percent higher than that of October."
"Sowould you elaborate more on this?"
"Is Asia region sort of losing momentum atthis moment?"
"Let's take a couple more."
"Why does thiskind of thinking happen, can you explain a little bit?"
"And finally, in south Asia, Bangladesh is the second fastest growingeconomy."
"So Asia as a whole growth outlook was also revised upward by over 0.1percent."
"Actually if you look at China, the growth ratein 2017 was 6.9 percent."
"Sowe and so India's growth rate has picked up too."
"So I will think it is a very positive development."
"That has benefited incomes both inthose producing countries but also consumers in consumption countries."
"But we areexpecting a further gradual decline to.9 percent growth next year."
"But,again, this is a natural evolution."
"The surprise was actually on the upside."
"And so I think we expect and hope that the reform momentum continues."
"Butyou are right, looking ahead there are important policy priorities."
"Andhere I would just highlight a few."
"So there is roomto do more on trade reform."
"I think your last question was on the outlook for Bangladesh."
"MR. RHEE: Let me clarify one thing."
